# Pre-workshop downloads

You must bring your own laptop to RailsBridge. If you have both a Windows system and a Mac or Linux one we suggest you bring the latter.

Please download the pre-requisite software onto your laptop computer before you attend the workshop. This helps speed things up on Friday and helps prevent the WiFi network from getting clogged.

### Students of the advanced class

We assume you've already made at least one Rails app in the past. If you already have a working Rails setup on your laptop, you do not need to do this. To check if you have a working Rails setup, try [creating a new Rails project](/curriculum/getting_started), running `bundle` and running the app with `rails server`. If you can see your newly created app in the browser, you're in the clear.

## OS X 10.6 and above:

First, download [Sublime Text 2 for Mac](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2.dmg).

Then pick one of the following options. The main difference is that Option 1 will
install Ruby and various tools directly into your computer operating system,
whereas Option 2 will install a temporary and easy-to-remove "virtual machine"
containing all the software you need for the workshop.

### Option 1. RailsInstaller

Download [Railsinstaller for Mac](http://railsinstaller.s3.amazonaws.com/RailsInstaller-1.0.4-osx-10.7.app.tgz) from the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org" target="_blank">RailsInstaller</a> webpage.

Don't worry about watching the video. Just leave the download in your Downloads folder.

### Option 2. Railsbridge Virtual Machine

Download
[VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88780-OSX.dmg)
for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.

Download [Vagrant](http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/db8e7a9c79b23264da129f55cf8569167fc22415/Vagrant-1.3.3.dmg) for Mac. Run the installer after it downloads.

Download
[this file](http://s3.amazonaws.com/railsbridgeboston/railsbridgevm-3.2-a.box) and save it somewhere on your desktop or home folder.

## OS X 10.5

First, download [Sublime Text 2 for Mac](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2.dmg).

Go to the [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/downloads),
and click Register. Fill out the first page with your account information.
The second page is a developer survey, which you can skip. Just go to the bottom and click
"Continue".

Once you have confirmed your developer account, you can download [Xcode
3.1.4](http://adcdownload.apple.com/Developer_Tools/xcode_3.1.4_developer_tools/xcode314_2809_developerdvd.dmg).
If that link doesn't work, go to the [downloads
page](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and search for "Xcode 3.1.4"

First, download [Sublime Text 2 for Windows](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2%20Setup.exe) -- or [64bit version](http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/Sublime%20Text%202.0.2%20x64%20Setup.exe).

Download
[VirtualBox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.18/VirtualBox-4.2.18-88781-Win.exe)
for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. You can quit the application

for Windows. Run the installer after it downloads. Agree to restart the computer if you're prompted to do so.
