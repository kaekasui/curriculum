Make A Posts Index Page

Requirements to advance
The user should be able to see each post’s name, author, and date published on the overview page (aka the index page).
The name of the post should link to the post show page.
The index page should include a “New Post” link or button.

Discussion Items
Maybe now would be a good time to discuss Active Record! Can anyone explain it?
