# Vote on posts

Make it like Reddit! Allow users to vote on posts they like or don't like. There are many ways you could do this, including a few gems.

## Features you could implement

- Allow users to like or dislike a post
- Make a listing of the posts with the most upvotes.
- Limit the number of times a user can vote (in a day, in a week, per category or tag)
- If you've implemented a profile, list a user's votes on their profile.
