# Inline Replying With Ajax

If you know some JavaScript and frontend web development, you may want to implement replying that does not refresh the page to make the user experience smoother.

## Features to implement
- Allow the reply form to be submitted remotely (ie. without refreshing the page)
- When a user replies inline, highlight and show the new reply under the previous replies
- Display error and success messages above the reply form
