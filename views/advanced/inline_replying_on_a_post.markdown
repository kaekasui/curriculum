# Inline Replying On A Post

## Requirements to advance
- The user should see the 'New Reply' form at the bottom of a Post's show page.
- The user should be able to make replies using the inlined 'New Reply' form.
- Error handling (trying to reply without any content) should still work the same way as when replying was a separate page.
