#Let's build a message board!

Assumptions made by this curriculum:

- You’ve gone through the standard RailsBridge installfest or already have a working Rails setup on your computer (ie. you can create a new rails app and get it to run locally using `rails server`)
- You’ve gone through the RailsBridge Suggestotron curriculum at least once before, or maybe a couple of times, or maybe you feel decently comfortable with Rails for some other reason.
- You want to learn more Rails!!!

## Goals

- Make a thing!
- Understand what the models, views, and controllers of a Rails app do and how they work together.
- Get more comfortable using error messages as guideposts and not as scary things.
- Play with some gems
- Choose features for your app and think about problems they may raise.

# What’s Going to Happen?

We’re going to build a message board system, where there are posts on the front page and you click through to see the original post plus discussion below.

We’ve divided this into challenges:

- Challenge 1: [create a new rails app with a static home page](create_a_new_rails_app_with_a_static_homepage)
- Challenge 2: [install devise](install_devise)
- Challenge 3: [make it pretty with bootstrap](make_it_pretty)
- Challenge 4: [add pages to create and look at individual posts](add_pages_to_create_and_look_at_individual_posts)
- Challenge 5: [make a posts index page](make_a_posts_index_page)
- Challenge 6: [add replying](add_replying)
- Challenge 7: [inline replying on a post](inline_replying_on_a_post)
- Challenge ∞: [other features of your choice](add_other_features_of_your_choosing)

Each time you get your app into a functional state, before adding any more features, COMMIT TO GIT! The new features will probably break things, which is neat, but you’ll want to be able to roll back to a prior version if necessary.

MAJORLY IMPORTANT NOTE: We called the sections challenges because they are challenging! This curriculum will be most fun as a collaboration — talk things through with your teacher, TAs, and other students. This is a very different style of curriculum than Suggestotron, so don’t be discouraged if you aren’t quite sure what to do next.

How to use this curriculum:

- Challenges are the big chunks of stuff to work on at a given time. These are gated by requirements — once you (or your group) has completed a set of requirements, go on to the next set.
- Requirements in this curriculum are not entirely divorced from what a requirement is in the agile software development methodology — things that should be in the application as defined by whoever is designing/deciding things about the product. Except here, we’ve also thrown in some non-application requirements, like the ability to explain a concept to a peer.
- Discussions are led by the teacher; this is the closest this curriculum gets to lecture-y teaching.
- Hints are what they sound like, as are Tools & References.
- The additional features have a number of suggestions that you could implement depending on time and interest. Some also have questions that may guide you in your future exploration as a developer!
