# railsbridge mtl

Railsbridge Montreal curriculum. Forked with <3 from Railsbridge Boston.

## Setup

For development, if you want to test the curriculum progress features,
create a local PostgreSQL database called 'students'.

Load the schema with

    psql students < schema.sql

This is not necessary if you're just editing the curriculum or other
static content.

To start the app:

    bundle
    rackup
